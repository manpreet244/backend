## NPM 
npm stands for Node Package Manager, and it is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is used to manage packages and dependencies in Node.js projects.
With npm, developers can easily install, update, and manage third-party packages that are necessary for their projects. npm also allows developers to publish their own packages for others to use.
